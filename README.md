# HTML Practice Programs

This repository contains five HTML programs that demonstrate foundational concepts in web development using HTML and basic CSS.

## Program Descriptions

1. **Registration Form**  
   A basic HTML form that collects user inputs including name, email, password, gender (radio buttons), and interests (checkboxes). Form data is submitted using the POST method to a PHP file.

2. **Table with Rowspan and Colspan**  
   An HTML table that utilizes the `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes to merge cells across rows and columns. This program demonstrates how to format structured data in a clear and readable format.

3. **Nested Lists for Course Outline**  
   Demonstrates the use of ordered and unordered lists, including nested list elements. This example presents a syllabus-like outline with multiple bullet types to represent different levels of hierarchy.

4. **Text Formatting in HTML**  
   Showcases various HTML tags used for text formatting, such as `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<mark>`, `<del>`, `<ins>`, `<code>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<blockquote>`, and `<abbr>`. Also includes usage of `<marquee>` and `<pre>`.

5. **Side-by-Side Websites Using Iframe**  
   Embeds two external websites (YouTube and Wikipedia) side by side using `<iframe>` elements. CSS Flexbox is used to create a responsive, two-column layout.

## Purpose

These programs are created for practice and learning purposes, providing hands-on experience with essential HTML elements including forms, tables, lists, text formatting, and media embedding.
